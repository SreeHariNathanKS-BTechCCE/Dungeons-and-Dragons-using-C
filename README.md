# Dungeons-and-Dragons-using-C
Dungeons and dragons is a tabletop role-playing fantasy game, where a group of friends sit around a table and pretend to be heroes going on an epic adventure together. The game being a role-playing one, takes place in the players' collective imagination. As the game goes on, the decisions made will shape the world they play in. 
Problem Statement
Design a miniature version of the game Dungeons and Dragons with similar rules and complex dynamics. 

On opening the app, the players will be given an option to create a gameroom for which a code will be generated. That code can be shared to the remaining players, allowing them to enter the gameroom. The players can connect over audio after entering, and the game can be started by clicking a button available onscreen.
